  PCL project compilation and generation using CMake with VS is currently the most convenient method. 

 The general steps are as follows: 

>  Write CMakeLists.txt and cpp files Use Cmake for project generation Use VS to open the project 

  After opening the sln file generated by CMake with VS, you can see three projects:

  The pcl_visualizer_demo in the middle is my project file, and the other two are generated by CMake. Click Run and an error will be reported:

  The solution to this problem is actually very simple. 

 Because the current default startup project is ALL_BUILD this project, not your own, so just set pcl_visualizer_demo this project as a startup project:
