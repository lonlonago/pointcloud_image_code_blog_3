Hello everyone. Last week we ushered in the first online sharing, the introduction of 3D model retrieval technology. This sharing is a relay sharing. There will be a keynote speaker sharing every week. I hope more small partners will join us to share and give themselves a chance to exercise. Here is a preview. The online live broadcast time is at 19:30 pm this Wednesday. Please pay more attention. 

 This week's online sharing session preview, the main topic: the application of deep learning in 3D scenes 

 Topic content, introduce the main tasks in 3D scenes and the challenges existing in the use of point cloud data. Introduce the current use of deep learning in point cloud data, targeting tasks such as object detection and scene segmentation. Combine Pointnet, Pointnet ++ and other deep learning frameworks for analysis and research. 

 Speaker: A graduate student in software engineering at ETU St. Petersburg, whose research direction is the application of deep learning in NLP and CV, Time: 19:30 2020-2-26 

 How to watch: Live Address: https://live.bilibili.com/21847497 

 How to participate in the discussion: Join the WeChat exchange group. During the live broadcast, you can send your own questions to the group, and discuss them after the live broadcast. How to join the group, comment at the end of the article, comment format "name + school/company", or directly send the keyword "online sharing and discussion WeChat group" in the official account to get the way to join the group. 

 Remarks: Since the speaker is abroad and uses the Bilibili live card, it is not smooth, so this time in the form of recording, the recording will have some impact on the questions and answers of the friends, so please be sure to add the WeChat group, ask questions in the WeChat group, and the part of the bullet comment will also be fed back to the speaker for some answers. 

 Next week's sharing session preview, the main topic: the use of CMake and the construction of projects, sharing content: how to use CMake to build C++ open source projects, introducing how to use Morden CMake to build C++ open source projects, including engineering structure, CMake syntax, open source project elements, etc. Speaker: Raymond, robot engineer, engaged in 3D vision, robot application software research and development, please look forward to it, welcome to share. 

 Advocating sharing, the original intention of the establishment of the point cloud PCL official account is to hope that everyone can take the initiative to share, actively communicate, and make progress together! So far, with point cloud and algorithm as the center, we have held several forums to share and exchange activities, and sometimes we can receive articles translated by students and share them on the official account platform for everyone to communicate and learn. However, the power of the group owner or some students alone is not enough to allow more willing people to join the team of sharing and learning from each other. I think everyone will have this feeling when they are in undergraduate or graduate school or at any time in the process of studying, that is, "no one communicates", there is no way to communicate and share the knowledge they have learned with their peers, or answer questions. This is a very painful thing. Therefore, I appeal to all researchers to actively sign up for this sharing relay. As long as you are willing to share, the content you share is your area of expertise, you can communicate, and you are welcome to contact the group owner. Give yourself a chance to communicate with more friends, and you will definitely gain more. The contact information of the group owner is as follows. 

 Later, let's have a relay sharing of point cloud technology enthusiasts! We look forward to having ideas and willing partners to join our online sharing group and share actively. The topics shared mainly include 3D vision, point cloud, high-precision maps, autonomous driving, and robotics-related fields. We look forward to researchers from various universities and technology experts from all walks of life to participate! Participation method: You can contact the group owner WeChat "920177957" (note required) or email: dianyunpcl@163.com, and enterprises are also welcome to contact the official account for cooperation.

 About us, the current WeChat exchange group continues to grow. Due to the large number of people, there are currently two groups. In order to encourage everyone to share, we hope that everyone can actively share while learning, and send your questions or small summaries to the main mailbox of the group owner dianyunpcl@163.com. If the above content is wrong or needs to be added, please leave a message! At the same time, everyone is welcome to pay attention to the WeChat official account, actively share submissions, or join the 3D visual WeChat group or QQ exchange group. It is not easy to be original. Please contact the group owner for reprinting and indicate the source
