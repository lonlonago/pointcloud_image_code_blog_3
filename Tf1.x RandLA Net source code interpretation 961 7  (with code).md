I have been using RandLANet for nearly a month, and I plan to document the entire process of RanLANet's semantic segmentation here. This series of blogs will use the Sematic3D dataset as an example to record the specific operation process of each step in combination with the source code. 

 Tf1.x RandLA-Net source code interpretation (1): Data preprocessing 

 Tf1.x RandLA-Net source code interpretation (2): Dataset 

 Tf1.x RandLA-Net Source Code Interpretation (3): Network Architecture 

 Tf1.x RandLA-Net source code interpretation (4): Model training 

 Tf1.x RandLA-Net Source Code Interpretation (5): Testing
